Language Model API
This repository contains a RESTful API service that interfaces with a BERT language model to perform text completion tasks. The API is built using FastAPI and adheres to industry standards for code quality, security, scalability, and maintainability.

Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a fully functional, deployable application that provides access to a language model for performing operations such as text completion or summarization.

Features
API Implementation: Provides endpoints to access the BERT language model for text completion.
Integration and Data Handling: Efficiently interacts with the language model and handles data input/output correctly.
Documentation: Includes clear instructions for setting up and using the service, along with examples of requests and responses for each endpoint.
Endpoints
POST /generate_text
Generate text based on the input text with a masked token.

Request Body


{
  "text": "The capital of Pakistan is [MASK]."
}
Response Body

json
Copy code
{
  "filled_texts": [
    "The capital of Pakistan is Islamabad.",
    "The capital of Pakistan is Karachi.",
    "The capital of Pakistan is Lahore.",
    "The capital of Pakistan is Peshawar.",
    "The capital of Pakistan is Sindh."
  ]
}
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone  https://github.com/findsah/language-model-api.git
cd language-model-api
Create a virtual environment and activate it:


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:


uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Test the API:

bash
Copy code
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate_text' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "text": "The capital of Pakistan is [MASK]."
}'
Reflection
Design Choices
Framework: FastAPI was chosen for its performance, ease of use, and excellent support for asynchronous operations.
Language Model: BERT (bert-base-uncased) was selected due to its strong performance on masked language modeling tasks.
Error Handling: The application includes comprehensive error handling to ensure robustness and reliability.
Scalability: The API is designed to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently, making it suitable for real-world use cases.
Future Considerations
Scalability: As the application grows, consider using distributed systems and load balancers to handle increased traffic.
Security: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API.
Maintenance: Ensure regular updates and monitoring to maintain the application's performance and security.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to create a professional, real-world application that interfaces with a language model. It reflects best practices in software development and is designed with scalability, maintainability, and security in mind.
